# Application's Purpose

This repo will contain two .cpp files, three header files, a MakeFile, and a ReadMe. The C++ files included are called "main.cpp" and "RPNCalc.cpp". The header files are "RPNCalc.h", "linkedlist.h", and "GenStack.h". The MakeFile is respectively named. "main.cpp" implements and handles all user prompts and execute program accordingly. "RPNCalc.cpp" acts as a post-fix calculator that takes post-fix notation and returns the calculation. "GenStack.h" is a template class of a stack using a linkedlist. "linkedlist.h" is a template class for a linked list. 

# Files
1. main.cpp
4. RPNCalc.cpp
5. RPNCalc.h
8. GenStack.h
9. linkedlist.h
10. Makefile
11. README.md
